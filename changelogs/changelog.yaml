  1.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Remove accidentally left-in ``print()`` statement in ``antsibull_fileutils.io.write_file()``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-fileutils/pull/5).

  1.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - '``CollectionCopier``''s ``source_directory`` argument now accepts ``pathlib.Path``
          objects in addition to ``str`` s (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-fileutils/pull/6).'
      minor_changes:
        - Declare support for Python 3.13 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-fileutils/pull/10).
        - 'Rewrite ``Copier`` and ``GitCopier`` so that both symlinks outside the
          tree and symlinks inside the tree are handled more correctly: symlinks inside
          the tree are kept, while for symlinks outside the tree the content is copied.
          Symlinks are normalized by default, which makes this behavior similar to
          ansible-core''s behavior in ``ansible-galaxy collection build``. Also copying
          now tries to preserve metadata (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-fileutils/pull/8).'

minor_changes:
  - "Rewrite ``Copier`` and ``GitCopier`` so that both symlinks outside the tree and symlinks inside the tree are handled more correctly:
     symlinks inside the tree are kept, while for symlinks outside the tree the content is copied.
     Also copying now tries to preserve metadata
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-fileutils/pull/8)."
